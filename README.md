# OculusLaserPointer

This projec provides a simple sample of the laser pointer set-up for both Canvas UI and 3D GameObject interaction in Unity using Oculus Integration. 

Currently it only works with a single controller. We'll continue to make it work with both controllers in the same scene. 

A tutorial is comming soon.
